# Automation Testing with Selenium and Jest

## For my university project, I automated tests for the Apple Store using tools like Selenium and Jest. I used Node.js, JavaScript, and TypeScript to ensure the website works well. This project helped me learn a lot about automated testing and web technologies.

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript
- JavaScript
- NodeJS
- Selenium
- Jest

## How to run
- Make sure you have Git installed. If not, install it from [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- Open Git Bash and type: `git clone "github_repository_url"` (Replace "github_repository_url" with the actual URL of the GitHub repository).
- Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
- Type `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
Change into the "tests" directory by typing `cd tests`.
Run the tests by typing `npm test fileName.test.ts` (Replace "fileName.test.ts" with the actual name of your test file).

⚠️ Note: Before running the application, make sure to run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
